# CricketProject
CS 4278 Project

Project Overview: This project is a roster and event management web-based application designed for club sports (specifically club cricket) at Vanderbilt University. Users will be split into two segments: administrators (team captains) and users (team players).

For administrators, the goal of this application is to allow them to create and manage their team of players. This will include features such as starting a team, adding/inviting members to that team, creating events, inviting members to those events, tracking event attendance, and inputting player statistics. 

For players, the goal of this application is to allow them to easily access upcoming team events and view their teamâ€™s statistics. This will include features such as joining a team, responding to events, seeing a calendar with all upcoming events, and viewing team statistics.
