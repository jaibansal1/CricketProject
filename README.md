**Project Overview**: 

This project is a roster and event management web-based application designed for club sports (specifically club cricket) at Vanderbilt University. Users will be split into two segments: administrators (team captains) and users (team players).

* Administrators will have functionality to create and manage their team of players. This will include features such as starting a team, adding/inviting members to that team, creating events, inviting members to those events, tracking event attendance, and inputting player statistics. 

* Users will have functionality to access upcoming team events and view their teamâ€™s statistics. This will include features such as joining a team, responding to events, seeing a calendar with all upcoming events, and viewing team statistics. 

**Installation**: 

Run "npm install" to install any relevant packages and npm start to test the app locally

**Deployment**: 

For deployment via Firebase Hosting, run "npm run build" and "firebase deploy"

**Technologies**: 

We will deploy our web application using Firebase Hosting and use Firebase Firestore as our database. For languages, we will primarily rely on Javascript, HTML, and CSS, as well as web application-oriented libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap and ReactJS. We will also leverage external APIs such as Firebase or Twilio to provide  notification/communication capabilities. 

**Design Prototypes**: 

We used Figma to design the pages and components of our web app and used its prototyping tool to show relationships between different pages and types of user interaction on our app. Our designs and prototyping can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/nlOfJQo7rmaynAPDKaIBwK/VCC-All-Pages?node-id=0%3A1 "Figma Link").
